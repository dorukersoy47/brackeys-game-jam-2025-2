Brackeys Game Jam 2025-2 - Game Systems Analysis
Overview
This is a bullet hell/dodge 'em up game featuring a furnace as the main antagonist. The game combines risk/reward mechanics with progressive difficulty and permanent upgrades. Players must survive increasingly difficult bullet patterns while managing their biscuit multiplier and deciding when to bank their earnings.

Core Game Loop
Start Phase: Player approaches the inactive furnace and presses F to activate
Active Phase: Survive bullet patterns while collecting passive coins
Risk Management: Choose between banking coins at shrines (with tax) or going for higher multipliers
Boss Evolution: Furnace transforms through phases (Normal → Shaking → Mobile)
Extraction: Press E near furnace to cash out and end the run
Progression: Use earned coins to purchase permanent upgrades

Spawns every 45 seconds during active runs
Active for 6 seconds before despawning
15% tax on banked coins (shrine_tax = 0.15)
Resets Biscuit Multiplier to 1.0
Collision-based interaction with player
Strategic Value:

Provides safe banking mid-run
Allows risk mitigation at cost of multiplier
Timing-based decision making
8. Temptation System (TemptationSpawner.gd)
Purpose: Risk/reward choices that modify game state

Temptation Types:

Blood for Batter:
Effect: Lose 25% current HP, gain +0.6 BM
High risk, high reward for skilled players
Bring the Heat:
Effect: Trigger elite burst immediately, gain unknown benefit
Increases immediate difficulty
Squeeze the Circle:
Effect: Arena shrinks by 10%, coin rate increases by 20%
Permanent space reduction for passive gain
System Flow:

Spawns every 25 seconds during active runs
Modal presentation with clear choices
Immediate effect application
Can significantly alter run difficulty
